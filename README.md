# What is this?
As a way of teaching myself React Native. I made a clone for the Clock app on iOS (No android support YET).

Make sure to have [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) installed

Installation:
```
yarn install
```

Start the server using:
```
yarn start
```

And then run on this app on a simulator with:
```
react-native run-ios
```
